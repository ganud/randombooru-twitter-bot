**W.I.P**

This web scraping project is split into three parts

- Scraping from danbooru, getting a random post from all of a specific tag(s) and saving the image using cheerio
- Automating twitter login and posts using playwright
- Scheduling tweets using cron, perhaps with some logic to avoid reusing posts due to random chance
