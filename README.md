# Randombooru Twitter Bot

## About

This projects aims to to automate twitter posting using tagged images from [danbooru](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=don_quixote_%28project_moon%29+solo+rating%3Ag&z=5) through use of web scrapers such as Playwright and Cheerio.

5.  In index.ts, replace arguments inside downloadRandomImagefromTag and postTweet with tags and tweet text of your choosing
6.  Run the script

```sh
npx tsx index.ts
```

This project is essentially 2 standalone scripts joined into a cron function to post the contents of the tweet through index.ts

1. twitter-login.ts, containing the twitter login and post logic
2. randoombooru.ts, containing getRandomPostfromTag to supply the link to download an image from to save and provide for twitter-login.ts

## Future ideas

- âœ… Getting the script to recognize whether a post has already been used (Uniques only). As of now I've mitigated this by comparing existing posts against a postgres database. getRandomUniquePostfromTag retries a set number of times until a unique post is returned, but this number is user-determined instead of a conditional. Danbooru doesn't give the number of posts when multiple tags are searched at the same time, so I can't be sure whether a particular tag combination is exhausted.
- Improving twitter-login.ts
  - The script sometimes throws an error when restricted by an email/phone prompt on deployment. This might be a delay issue, as the login is successful on the second attempt, implying the email was entered but couldn't find the password selector on the first attempt.
  - Sometimes twitter asks for the phone or username, but I've only implemented email as of writing. It doesn't help that the prompt itself is relatively uncommon.
